Observations: HW0 was not graded for credit, and many students did not submit the assignment, so I expect grading to take significantly longer next assignment. I'll need to find a way to grade more efficiently if I want to have any hope of not exceeding 20 hours/week.

Observations: I held my first discussion section, which was a lot of fun. I was asked a few questions I didn't know how to solve right away, but was able to work out the answer with them, explaining my thought process as we moved towards the solution.
<br/>I'd like to focus on talking less in the future and getting the other students more involved instead. I think I'd benefit from more methodically trying to identify the heart of the question being asked as well.
